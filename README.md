# Schwaddy News Reader (Mobile)

This is a project of [Nick Schwaderer](https://github.com/schwad) to build a basic iOS/Android application with React-Native.

The finished product will be a Schwaddy News Reader that connects to an API I built for [The Schwaddy News Website](https://schwaddy-news.herokuapp.com).
